# Lab 5 - Paho-MQTT

The focus of Lab 5 was to demonstrate the actions of sending and receiving using a message service (Mosquitto and Paho).
This lab was completed by using my SSH with my Raspberry Pi.

## Mosquitto

I omitted showing the steps of the installation process for Mosquitto since the publish-subscribe system running would prove that I successfully installed the MQTT implementation correctly.
